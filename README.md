# React/Redux Course Material

## Session 1: React
The code samples for the first session on React components can be found in [Session1](/Session1).  This folder 
contains two projects.

  - hello: examples of JSX vs pure JS components
  - components: examples of functional, class, and composed components
  
## Session 2: Redux
The code sample for the second session on Rdux can be found in [Session2](/Session2).  This folder contains 
one project that demonstraits a Redux Todo application.  This application does not persist its data to a 
backend database, so refreshing the page resets all of the data.  We may wire it up as a later lesson.
